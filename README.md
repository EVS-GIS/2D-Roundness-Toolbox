# 2D-Roundness-Toolbox
These are files of the Roussillon et al (2009) toolbox computing 2D roundness indexes of particles imaged on a 1mÂ² redboard.

It was designed for Windows environment but might work on other operating system (you can try)

To use it, you have to download all files in a folder and then, the best is to read the tutorial.
