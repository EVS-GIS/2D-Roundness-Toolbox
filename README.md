# 2D-Roundness-Toolbox
The shape of sedimentary particles is an important property, from which geographical hypotheses related to abrasion, distance of transport, river behavior, etc. can be formulated.
Roundness is a measure of how much the corners and edges of a particle have been worn away.
Tristan Roussillon developed several programs to automatically compute roundness shape parameters of particles imaged on a 1m2 redboard.

It was developed in 2009, in C++ language, for Windows operating system.
It was used on Windows OS until Windows 7. No guarantee applies for newer Windows version.

To use it, you have to download all files and then follow indications in the Guidelines documentation.
Development and user interface were written in French but guidelines documentation offers an English translation.
